MSC DISSERTATION PROJECT

TITLE: "Sequence and pharmacophore analysis of DNA recognition helices in the HTH family of proteins and their binding DNA"

Overview: The helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif is a highly conserved structural domain found in a wide range
of DNA-binding proteins across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This project aims to investigate
the sequence and pharmacophore patterns of HTH motifs, particularly within the recognition
helices responsible for specific DNA interaction.
